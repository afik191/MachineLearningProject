# 🧠 Supervised Learning Workflow
This project demonstrates a complete Linear Regression model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It was created as part of an academic assignment and covers everything from data preparation to model evaluation.


# 📂 Contents
* Assignment2_supervised_learning_flow.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with full code and explanations.

* Implementation of cross-validation with GridSearchCV.

* Feature engineering, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

# 🔍 Highlights
Data Preprocessing:

* Feature Scaling – Scaling of features using methods like StandardScaler or similar

* Feature modifing - creating/deleting of features for better model performance

Model Selection:

* Evaluation using 5-fold cross-validation

* Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning

Machine Learning Models Used:

* Logistic Regression 

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using standard regression metrics:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

* R² Score – Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.



# 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.

2. Open the notebook with Jupyter: jupyter notebook Assignment2_supervised_learning_flow.ipynb

3. run the cells
